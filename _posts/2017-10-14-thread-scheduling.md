Right now I was studying about how CPU and Windows schedule a thread and how can they find the current thread and next thread or even a list of threads that are ready to run,Honestly I don't find any good example which explains about how it manages by kernel structures then I found this ppt file which seems to be a presentation from Microsoft. (I'm not sure.) But I should say its writer (David B. Probert) gives me a lot of new information about how Windows Manages its threads.

I make a copy and upload it for you so you can download it from [here](/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/02/ThreadScheduling.ppt).
