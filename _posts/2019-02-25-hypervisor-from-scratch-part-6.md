## Overview

In the 6th part, we'll see how we can virtualize our currently running system by configuring VMCS. We use monitoring features of VMX to detect the execution of important instructions like CPUID (and change the result of CPUID from user-mode and kernel-mode), detect modifications on different control registers, and describe VMX capabilities on different microarchitectures, talking about MSR Bitmaps and lots of other cool things.

Before starting, I should give my special thanks to my friend [Petr Benes](https://twitter.com/PetrBenes) as he always solves my problems, explains to me patiently, and gives me ideas to implement a hypervisor from scratch.

The full source code of this tutorial is available on GitHub :

\[[https://github.com/SinaKarvandi/Hypervisor-From-Scratch](https://github.com/SinaKarvandi/Hypervisor-From-Scratch)\]

**Note:** Please keep in mind that hypervisors change during the time because new features are added to the operating systems or using new technologies. For example, updates to Meltdown & Spectre have made a lot of changes to the hypervisors, so if you want to use Hypervisor From Scratch in your projects, research, or whatever, you have to use the driver from the latest parts of these tutorial series as this tutorial is actively updated and changes are applied to the newer parts (earlier parts keep untouched) so you might encounter errors and instability problems in the earlier parts thus make sure to use the latest parts in real-world projects.

Please make sure to have your own lab to test your hypervisor. I tested my hypervisor on the 7th generation of Intel processors, so if you use an older processor, it might not support some features on your processor, and without a remote kernel debugger (not the local kernel debugger), you might see your system halting or BSODs without understanding the actual error.

## VMX 0-settings and 1-settings

In the previous parts, we implemented a function called **AdjustControl**. This is an essential part of each hypervisor as you might want to run your hypervisor on many different processors with different microarchitectures. We should be aware of our processor capabilities to avoid undefined behaviors and VM-Entry errors.

This works like this; first, an MSR is sent the below function, which indicates the VMCS control that needs to be modified. Then we check the corresponding MSR to understand the 1-settings and 0-settings of the control. At last, we remove the not supported bits, set those that are mandatory to be 1, and configure the control.

```
ULONG
AdjustControls(ULONG Ctl, ULONG Msr)
{
    MSR MsrValue = {0};

    MsrValue.Content = __readmsr(Msr);
    Ctl &= MsrValue.High; /* bit == 0 in high word ==> must be zero */
    Ctl |= MsrValue.Low;  /* bit == 1 in low word  ==> must be one  */
    return Ctl;
}
```

If you remember from the previous part, we used the above function in 4 situations.

```
    __vmx_vmwrite(CPU_BASED_VM_EXEC_CONTROL, AdjustControls(CPU_BASED_ACTIVATE_MSR_BITMAP | CPU_BASED_ACTIVATE_SECONDARY_CONTROLS, MSR_IA32_VMX_PROCBASED_CTLS));
    __vmx_vmwrite(SECONDARY_VM_EXEC_CONTROL, AdjustControls(CPU_BASED_CTL2_RDTSCP | CPU_BASED_CTL2_ENABLE_INVPCID | CPU_BASED_CTL2_ENABLE_XSAVE_XRSTORS, MSR_IA32_VMX_PROCBASED_CTLS2));

    __vmx_vmwrite(PIN_BASED_VM_EXEC_CONTROL, AdjustControls(0, MSR_IA32_VMX_PINBASED_CTLS));
    __vmx_vmwrite(VM_EXIT_CONTROLS, AdjustControls(VM_EXIT_IA32E_MODE /* | VM_EXIT_ACK_INTR_ON_EXIT */, MSR_IA32_VMX_EXIT_CTLS));
    __vmx_vmwrite(VM_ENTRY_CONTROLS, AdjustControls(VM_ENTRY_IA32E_MODE, MSR_IA32_VMX_ENTRY_CTLS));
```

A brief look at **APPENDIX A -VMX CAPABILITY REPORTING FACILITY** shows the explanation about **RESERVED CONTROLS AND DEFAULT SETTINGS**. In Intel VMX, certain controls are reserved and must be set to a specific value (0 or 1) determined by the processor. The specific value to which a reserved control must be set is its **default setting**. These kinds of settings vary for each processor and microarchitecture, but in general, there are three types of classes :

- **Always-flexible**: These have never been reserved.  
- **Default0**: These are (or have been) reserved with a default setting of 0. 
- **Default1**: They are (or have been) reserved with a default setting of 1.

Now, There are separate capability MSRs for **pin-based VM-execution controls**, **primary processor-based VM-execution controls**, **VM-Entry Controls**, **VM-Exit Controls** and **secondary processor-based VM-execution controls**.

These MSRs are used to check the above controls:

- MSR\_IA32\_VMX\_PROCBASED\_CTLS
- MSR\_IA32\_VMX\_PROCBASED\_CTLS2
- MSR\_IA32\_VMX\_EXIT\_CTLS
- MSR\_IA32\_VMX\_ENTRY\_CTLS
- MSR\_IA32\_VMX\_PINBASED\_CTLS

In all of the above MSRs, bits **31:0** indicate the allowed 0-settings of these controls. VM entry allows control X (bit X) to be 0 if bit X in the MSR is cleared to 0; if bit X in the MSR is set to 1, VM entry fails if control X is 0. Meanwhile, bits **63:32** indicate the allowed 1-settings of these controls. VM entry allows control X to be 1 if bit 32+X in the MSR is set to 1; if bit 32+X in the MSR is cleared to 0, VM entry fails if control X is 1.

Although there are some exceptions, now, you should understand the purpose of **AdjustControls** as it first reads the MSR corresponding to the VM-execution control, then adjusts the 0-settings and 1-settings, and return the final result.

I recommend seeing the result of **AdjustControls** specifically for **MSR\_IA32\_VMX\_PROCBASED\_CTLS** and **MSR\_IA32\_VMX\_PROCBASED\_CTLS2** as you might unintentionally set some of the bits to 1 so, you should have a plan for handling some VM-Exits based on your specific processor.

## VMX-Fixed Bits in CR0 and CR4

For CR0, **IA32\_VMX\_CR0\_FIXED0** MSR (index 486H) and **IA32\_VMX\_CR0\_FIXED1** MSR (index 487H) and for CR4 **IA32\_VMX\_CR4\_FIXED0** MSR (index 488H) and **IA32\_VMX\_CR4\_FIXED1** MSR (index 489H) indicate how bits in CR0 and CR4 may be set in VMX operation. If bit X is 1 in **IA32\_VMX\_CRx\_FIXED0**, then that bit of CRx is fixed to 1 in VMX operation. Similarly, if bit X is 0 in **IA32\_VMX\_CRx\_FIXED1**, then that bit of CRx is fixed to 0 in VMX operation. It is always the case that if bit X is 1 in **IA32\_VMX\_CRx\_FIXEDx**, then that bit is also 1 in **IA32\_VMX\_CRx\_FIXED1**.

## Capturing the State of the Current Machine

In the 5th part, we saw how to configure different VMCS fields and finally execute our instruction (HLT) under the guest context. This part is similar to the last part, with some minor changes in some VMCS attributes. Let's review and see the differences.

The first thing you need to know is that you have to create different stacks for each core as we're going to virtualize all the cores simultaneously. These stacks will be used whenever a VM-Exit occurs.

```
    //
    // Allocate stack for the VM Exit Handler
    //
    UINT64 VmmStackVa                  = ExAllocatePoolWithTag(NonPagedPool, VMM_STACK_SIZE, POOLTAG);
    g_GuestState[ProcessorID].VmmStack = VmmStackVa;

    if (g_GuestState[ProcessorID].VmmStack == NULL)
    {
        DbgPrint("[*] Error in allocating VMM Stack\n");
        return FALSE;
    }
    RtlZeroMemory(g_GuestState[ProcessorID].VmmStack, VMM_STACK_SIZE);

    DbgPrint("[*] VMM Stack for logical processor %d : %llx\n", ProcessorID, g_GuestState[ProcessorID].VmmStack);
```

As you can see from the above code, we use `VmmStack` for each core separately (defined in the `VIRTUAL_MACHINE_STATE` structure).

All the other things like clearing the VMCS state, loading VMCS, and executing VMLAUNCH are exactly the same as the previous part, so I don't want to describe them again but see the function responsible for preparing our current core to be virtualized.

```
VOID
VirtualizeCurrentSystem(int ProcessorID, PEPTP EPTP, PVOID GuestStack)
{
    DbgPrint("\n======================== Virtualizing Current System (Logical Core 0x%x) =============================\n", ProcessorID);

    //
    // Clear the VMCS State
    //
    if (!ClearVmcsState(&g_GuestState[ProcessorID]))
    {
        goto ErrorReturn;
    }

    //
    // Load VMCS (Set the Current VMCS)
    //
    if (!LoadVmcs(&g_GuestState[ProcessorID]))
    {
        goto ErrorReturn;
    }

    DbgPrint("[*] Setting up VMCS for current system.\n");
    SetupVmcsAndVirtualizeMachine(&g_GuestState[ProcessorID], EPTP, GuestStack);

    //
    // Change this hook (detect modification of MSRs using RDMSR & WRMSR)
    //
    // DbgPrint("[*] Setting up MSR bitmaps.\n");

    DbgPrint("[*] Executing VMLAUNCH.\n");
    __vmx_vmlaunch();

    //
    // if VMLAUNCH succeeds will never be here!
    //
    ULONG64 ErrorCode = 0;
    __vmx_vmread(VM_INSTRUCTION_ERROR, &ErrorCode);
    __vmx_off();
    DbgPrint("[*] VMLAUNCH Error : 0x%llx\n", ErrorCode);
    DbgBreakPoint();

    DbgPrint("\n===================================================================\n");

ReturnWithoutError:

    __vmx_off();
    DbgPrint("[*] VMXOFF Executed Successfully!\n");

    return TRUE;

    //
    // Return With Error
    //
ErrorReturn:
    DbgPrint("[*] Fail to setup VMCS!\n");

    return FALSE;
}
```

From the above code, `SetupVmcsAndVirtualizeMachine` is new, so let's see what's inside this function.

### Configuring VMCS Fields

VMCS Fields are nothing new. We should configure these fields to manage the state of the virtualized core.

All the VMCS fields are the same as the last part, except for the configuration of VMCS control bits:

```
    DbgPrint("[*] MSR_IA32_VMX_PROCBASED_CTLS : 0x%llx\n", AdjustControls(CPU_BASED_ACTIVATE_MSR_BITMAP | CPU_BASED_ACTIVATE_SECONDARY_CONTROLS, MSR_IA32_VMX_PROCBASED_CTLS));
    DbgPrint("[*] MSR_IA32_VMX_PROCBASED_CTLS2 : 0x%llx\n", AdjustControls(CPU_BASED_CTL2_RDTSCP | CPU_BASED_CTL2_ENABLE_INVPCID | CPU_BASED_CTL2_ENABLE_XSAVE_XRSTORS, MSR_IA32_VMX_PROCBASED_CTLS2));

    __vmx_vmwrite(CPU_BASED_VM_EXEC_CONTROL, AdjustControls(CPU_BASED_ACTIVATE_MSR_BITMAP | CPU_BASED_ACTIVATE_SECONDARY_CONTROLS , MSR_IA32_VMX_PROCBASED_CTLS));
    __vmx_vmwrite(SECONDARY_VM_EXEC_CONTROL, AdjustControls(CPU_BASED_CTL2_RDTSCP | CPU_BASED_CTL2_ENABLE_INVPCID | CPU_BASED_CTL2_ENABLE_XSAVE_XRSTORS, MSR_IA32_VMX_PROCBASED_CTLS2));
```

As you can see, for the **CPU\_BASED\_VM\_EXEC\_CONTROL**, we set **CPU\_BASED\_ACTIVATE\_MSR\_BITMAP**; this way, we can enable the MSR BITMAP filter (described later in this part). Setting this field is somehow mandatory. As you might guess, Windows accesses lots of MSRs during a simple kernel execution, so if we don't set this bit, then we'll exit on each MSR access, and of course, our VMX Exit-Handler is called, hence clearing this bit to zero makes the system substantially slower.

For the **SECONDARY\_VM\_EXEC\_CONTROL**, we use **CPU\_BASED\_CTL2\_RDTSCP** to enable **RDTSCP**, **CPU\_BASED\_CTL2\_ENABLE\_INVPCID** to enable **INVPCID** and the **CPU\_BASED\_CTL2\_ENABLE\_XSAVE\_XRSTORS** to enable **XSAVE** and **XRSTORS**.

It's because I run the above code in my Windows 10 1809 and see that Windows uses **INVPCID** and **XSAVE** for its internal use (in the processors that support these features), so if you didn't enable them before virtualizing the core, then it probably leads to error.

Note that **RDTSCP** reads the current value of the processor's time-stamp counter into the **EDX:EAX** registers and also reads the value of the **IA32\_TSC\_AUX** MSR (address C0000103H) into the **ECX** register. This instruction adds ordering to RDTSC and makes performance measures more accurate than **RDTSC**. 

**INVPCID** invalidates mappings in the translation lookaside buffers (TLBs) and paging-structure caches based on the process-context identifier (PCID), and **XSAVE** Performs a full or partial save of processor state components to the **XSAVE** area located at the memory address specified by the destination operand.

Please ensure to review the final value that you put on these fields as your processor might not support all these features, so you have to implement some additional functions or ignore some of them.

Nothing is left in this function except **GuestStack**, which is used as the **GUEST\_RSP**. I'll tell you what to put in this argument later.

```
__vmx_vmwrite(GUEST_RSP, (ULONG64)GuestStack);     //setup guest sp
```

OK, now the problem is from where we can start our hypervisor. I mean, how to save the state of a particular core, then execute the **VMLAUNCH** instruction on it, and then continue the rest of the execution.

For this purpose, I've changed the `DrvCreate` routine, so you must change `CreateFile` from the user-mode application (I will discuss it later). In fact, `DrvCreate` is the function responsible for putting all the cores in the VMX state. First, it queries the core's count and then performs the necessary initialization for each core.

```
NTSTATUS
DrvCreate(IN PDEVICE_OBJECT DeviceObject, IN PIRP Irp)
{
    DbgPrint("[*] DrvCreate Called !\n");

    //
    // *** Start Virtualizing Current System ***
    //

    //
    // Initiating EPTP and VMX
    //
    PEPTP EPTP = InitializeEptp();
    InitializeVmx();

    int LogicalProcessorsCount = KeQueryActiveProcessorCount(0);

    for (size_t i = 0; i < LogicalProcessorsCount; i++)
    {
        // Launching VM for Test (in the all logical processor)
        int ProcessorID = i;

        // Allocating VMM Stack
        AllocateVmmStack(ProcessorID);

        // Allocating MSR Bit
        AllocateMsrBitmap(ProcessorID);

        RunOnProcessor(i, EPTP, VmxSaveState);
        DbgPrint("\n======================================================================================================\n", ProcessorID);
    }

    Irp->IoStatus.Status      = STATUS_SUCCESS;
    Irp->IoStatus.Information = 0;
    IoCompleteRequest(Irp, IO_NO_INCREMENT);

    return STATUS_SUCCESS;
}
```

Our tiny driver is designed to be used in uni-core, two, three, and even all the cores. As you can see from the code below, it queries the logical processor count.

```
    int LogicalProcessorsCount = KeQueryActiveProcessorCount(0);
```

You can edit this line to virtualize a certain number of cores or just a specific core, but the above code virtualizes all the cores by default.

### Changing IRQL on all Cores

There is a function called `RunOnProcessor`. This function takes processor ID as its first parameter, the EPTP pointer (explained in the 4th part) as the second parameter, and a particular routine called `VmxSaveState` as the third. 

`RunOnProcessor` sets the processor affinity to a special core, then it raises the IRQL to Dispatch-Level so the Windows Scheduler can't kick in to change the context; thus, it runs our routine, and when it returns from `VmxSaveState`, the currently running core is virtualized so it can lower the IRQL to what it was before. Now Windows can continue its normal execution while it is under the hypervisor's governance. IRQL stands for **I**nterrupt **R**e**q**uest **L**evel, a Windows-specific mechanism to manage interrupts or give priority by their level, so raising IRQL means your routine will execute with higher priority than normal Windows codes (`PASSIVE\_LEVEL` & `APC_LEVEL`). For more information, you can visit [here](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/doronh/2010/02/02/what-is-irql/).

The `RunOnProcessor` code is shown below.

```
BOOLEAN
RunOnProcessor(ULONG ProcessorNumber, PEPTP EPTP, PFUNC Routine)
{
    KIRQL OldIrql;

    KeSetSystemAffinityThread((KAFFINITY)(1 << ProcessorNumber));

    OldIrql = KeRaiseIrqlToDpcLevel();

    Routine(ProcessorNumber, EPTP);

    KeLowerIrql(OldIrql);

    KeRevertToUserAffinityThread();

    return TRUE;
}
```

`VmxSaveState` has to save the state and call another function, `VirtualizeCurrentSystem`.

We have to use this function in the assembly file (VMXState.asm) as all `VmxSaveState` is implemented in assembly. For using a C function, in the assembly, we can write the function name and use the **EXTERN** keyword. 

The following example shows how we can use the `VirtualizeCurrentSystem` in the assembly file. 

```
EXTERN VirtualizeCurrentSystem:PROC
```

The `VMXSaveState` is implemented like this (in assembly):

```
VmxSaveState PROC

	PUSH RAX
	PUSH RCX
	PUSH RDX
	PUSH RBX
	PUSH RBP
	PUSH RSI
	PUSH RDI
	PUSH R8
	PUSH R9
	PUSH R10
	PUSH R11
	PUSH R12
	PUSH R13
	PUSH R14
	PUSH R15

	SUB RSP, 28h

	; It a x64 FastCall function but as long as the definition of SaveState is the same
	; as VirtualizeCurrentSystem, so we RCX & RDX both have a correct value
	; But VirtualizeCurrentSystem also has a stack, so it's the third argument
	; and according to FastCall, it should be in R8

	MOV R8, RSP

	CALL VirtualizeCurrentSystem

	RET

VmxSaveState ENDP
```

It first saves the state of all registers, subtracts the stack because of **Shadow Space** for fast call functions, and then puts **RSP to **R8** and calls the `VirtualizeCurrentSystem`. RSP should be moved into the R8 (as I told you for `GuestStack` ) because the x64 fastcall parameter should be passed in this order: **RCX**, **RDX**, **R8**, **R9** + **Stack**. This means that our third argument to this function is current **RSP**, and this value will be used as `GUEST_RSP` in the VMCS.

If the above function runs without error, we should never reach to `ret` instruction as the state will later continue in another function called `VmxRestoreState`.

As we can see in the `VirtualizeCurrentSystem`, which eventually calls `SetupVmcsAndVirtualizeMachine`, the **GUEST\_RIP** is pointing to `VmxRestoreState`, so the first routine that executes in the current core is `VmxRestoreState`. 

This function is defined like this :

```
VmxRestoreState PROC

	ADD RSP, 28h
	POP R15
	POP R14
	POP R13
	POP R12
	POP R11
	POP R10
	POP R9
	POP R8
	POP RDI
	POP RSI
	POP RBP
	POP RBX
	POP RDX
	POP RCX
	POP RAX
	
	RET
	
VmxRestoreState ENDP
```

In the above function, first, we remove the **Shadow Space** and restore the registers state. 

When we return to `RunOnProcessor`, it's time to lower the IRQL.

This function will be called many times (based on our logical cores count), and eventually, all of our cores are under VMX operation, and now we are in the **VMX non-root operation**.

## Changing the User-Mode App

Based on the above assumptions, we have to make some trivial changes in our user-mode application so after loading the driver, it can be used to notify kernel-mode code to start and finally end of loading the hypervisor.

### Getting a handle using CreateFile

After some checks for the vendor and presence of hypervisor, now we have to call `DrvCreate` from the kernel-mode, and it's through the `CreateFile` user-mode function.

```
    HANDLE Handle = CreateFile("\\\\.\\MyHypervisorDevice",
                               GENERIC_READ | GENERIC_WRITE,
                               FILE_SHARE_READ |
                                   FILE_SHARE_WRITE,
                               NULL, /// lpSecurityAttirbutes
                               OPEN_EXISTING,
                               FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL |
                                   FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED,
                               NULL); /// lpTemplateFile

    if (Handle == INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE)
    {
        DWORD ErrNum = GetLastError();
        printf("[*] CreateFile failed : %d\n", ErrNum);
        return 1;
    }
```

`CreateFile` gives us a handle that can be used in our future functions to interact with our driver. Still, whenever we close the application or call `CloseHandle` in the user-mode, the `DrvClose` is automatically called in the kernel. `DrvClose` turns off the hypervisor and restores the state to what it was before (not virtualized).

## Using VMX Monitoring Features

After configuring all the above fields, it's time to use the monitoring features of the VMX. We'll see how these features are unique in the case of security applications or reverse engineering tasks. As an extra resource, you can use [HyperDbg Debugger](https://hyperdbg.com). HyperDbg is a hypervisor-based debugger that allows us to use most of these VT-x features in our debugging journey. 

### CR3-Target Controls

The VM-execution control fields include a set of 4 CR3-target values and a CR3-target count. If you remember the VMCS  fields that I presented before in the `SetupVmcsAndVirtualizeMachine`, you can see the following lines :

```
    __vmx_vmwrite(CR3_TARGET_COUNT, 0);
    __vmx_vmwrite(CR3_TARGET_VALUE0, 0);
    __vmx_vmwrite(CR3_TARGET_VALUE1, 0);
    __vmx_vmwrite(CR3_TARGET_VALUE2, 0);
    __vmx_vmwrite(CR3_TARGET_VALUE3, 0);
```

Intel defines CR3-Target controls like this :

An execution of MOV to CR3 in VMX non-root operation does not cause a VM exit if its source operand matches one of these values. If the CR3-target count is n, only the first n CR3-target values are considered.

The implementation of using this feature is like this :

```
BOOLEAN
SetTargetControls(UINT64 CR3, UINT64 Index)
{
    //
    // Index starts from 0 , not 1
    //
    if (Index >= 4)
    {
        //
        // Not supported for more than 4 , at least for now :(
        //
        return FALSE;
    }

    UINT64 temp = 0;

    if (CR3 == 0)
    {
        if (g_Cr3TargetCount <= 0)
        {
            //
            // Invalid command as g_Cr3TargetCount cannot be less than zero
            // s
            return FALSE;
        }
        else
        {
            g_Cr3TargetCount -= 1;
            if (Index == 0)
            {
                __vmx_vmwrite(CR3_TARGET_VALUE0, 0);
            }
            if (Index == 1)
            {
                __vmx_vmwrite(CR3_TARGET_VALUE1, 0);
            }
            if (Index == 2)
            {
                __vmx_vmwrite(CR3_TARGET_VALUE2, 0);
            }
            if (Index == 3)
            {
                __vmx_vmwrite(CR3_TARGET_VALUE3, 0);
            }
        }
    }
    else
    {
        if (Index == 0)
        {
            __vmx_vmwrite(CR3_TARGET_VALUE0, CR3);
        }
        if (Index == 1)
        {
            __vmx_vmwrite(CR3_TARGET_VALUE1, CR3);
        }
        if (Index == 2)
        {
            __vmx_vmwrite(CR3_TARGET_VALUE2, CR3);
        }
        if (Index == 3)
        {
            __vmx_vmwrite(CR3_TARGET_VALUE3, CR3);
        }
        g_Cr3TargetCount += 1;
    }

    __vmx_vmwrite(CR3_TARGET_COUNT, g_Cr3TargetCount);
    return TRUE;
}
```

I don't have any good example of how this control might be helpful in a regular Windows as there are thousands of CR3 changes for each process. Still, one of my friends told me that it's used in some special cases in scientific projects to improve the overall performance.

### Handling guest CPUID execution

**CPUID** is an instruction that unconditionally causes VM-exit. As you know, **CPUID** is used because it allows the software to discover details of the processor. It is also used for flushing the pipeline for processors that don't support instructions like **RDTSCP**, so they can use **CPUID + RDTSC** and use **CPUID** as a barrier.

Whenever any software in any privilege level executes a **CPUID** instruction, our vm-exit handler is called, and now we can decide whatever we want to show to the software. For example, previously, I published an article "[Defeating malware's Anti-VM techniques (CPUID-Based Instructions)](https://rayanfam.com/topics/defeating-malware-anti-vm-techniques-cpuid-based-instructions/)". This article describes how to configure VMware Workstation in a way that changes the **CPUID** instruction results so that the malware with an anti-VM technique can't understand that they're executing in a virtualized environment. VMware Workstation (and other virtual environments) perform the same mechanism for handling **CPUID**. In the following example, I just passed the state of registers (state of registers before the VM-exits) to the `HandleCPUID`. This function decides whether the requested **CPUID** should have a modified result or just execute passthrough the original results.

The default behavior for handling every VM-Exit (caused by execution of **CPUID** in VMX non-root) is to get the original result by using `_cpuidex`, which is the intrinsic function for **CPUID**.

```
    __cpuidex(CpuInfo, (INT32)state->rax, (INT32)state->rcx);
```

As you can see, VMX non-root by itself isn't able to execute a **CPUID**, and we can execute **CPUID** in VMX root-mode and give back the results to the VMX non-root mode.

We need to check if **RAX** (**CPUID** Index) was **1** or not. It's because there is an indicator bit that shows whether the current machine is running under a hypervisor or not. Like many other virtual machines, we set the present hypervisor bit (the constant used in this example is like hyper-v's bit `HYPERV_HYPERVISOR_PRESENT_BIT`) to show that we're running under a hypervisor.

There is a second check about the hypervisor provider. We set it to '**HVFS**' to show that our hypervisor is \[**H**\]yper\[**V**\]isor \[**F**\]rom \[**S**\]cratch.

```
    //
    // Check if this was CPUID 1h, which is the features request
    //
    if (state->rax == 1)
    {
        //
        // Set the Hypervisor Present-bit in RCX, which Intel and AMD have both
        // reserved for this indication
        //
        CpuInfo[2] |= HYPERV_HYPERVISOR_PRESENT_BIT;
    }

    else if (state->rax == HYPERV_CPUID_INTERFACE)
    {
        //
        // Return our interface identifier
        //
        CpuInfo[0] = 'HVFS'; // [H]yper[V]isor [F]rom [S]cratch
    }
```

We can easily add more checks to the above code and customize our CPUID filter, for instance, changing our computer vendor string, etc.

Finally, we put them into registers so that the guest has a proper result every time our routine is executed.

```
    //
    // Copy the values from the logical processor registers into the VP GPRs
    //
    state->rax = CpuInfo[0];
    state->rbx = CpuInfo[1];
    state->rcx = CpuInfo[2];
    state->rdx = CpuInfo[3];
```

Putting all the above codes together, we have the following function:

```
BOOLEAN
HandleCPUID(PGUEST_REGS state)
{
    INT32 CpuInfo[4];
    ULONG Mode = 0;

    //
    // Check for the magic CPUID sequence, and check that it is coming from
    // Ring 0. Technically we could also check the RIP and see if this falls
    // in the expected function, but we may want to allow a separate "unload"
    // driver or code at some point
    //

    __vmx_vmread(GUEST_CS_SELECTOR, &Mode);
    Mode = Mode & RPL_MASK;

    if ((state->rax == 0x41414141) && (state->rcx == 0x42424242) && Mode == DPL_SYSTEM)
    {
        return TRUE; // Indicates we have to turn off VMX
    }

    //
    // Otherwise, issue the CPUID to the logical processor based on the indexes
    // on the VP's GPRs
    //
    __cpuidex(CpuInfo, (INT32)state->rax, (INT32)state->rcx);

    //
    // Check if this was CPUID 1h, which is the features request
    //
    if (state->rax == 1)
    {
        //
        // Set the Hypervisor Present-bit in RCX, which Intel and AMD have both
        // reserved for this indication
        //
        CpuInfo[2] |= HYPERV_HYPERVISOR_PRESENT_BIT;
    }

    else if (state->rax == HYPERV_CPUID_INTERFACE)
    {
        //
        // Return our interface identifier
        //
        CpuInfo[0] = 'HVFS'; // [H]yper[V]isor [F]rom [S]cratch
    }

    //
    // Copy the values from the logical processor registers into the VP GPRs
    //
    state->rax = CpuInfo[0];
    state->rbx = CpuInfo[1];
    state->rcx = CpuInfo[2];
    state->rdx = CpuInfo[3];

    return FALSE; // Indicates we don't have to turn off VMX
}
```

It's somehow like instruction level hooking for **CPUID**. Also, you can have the same handling functions for many other important instructions by configuring the primary and secondary processor-based controls. Later we describe some of these instructions.

### Prevent CPUID Timing Leakages

As an extra explanation about the hypervisor, **CPUID** is one of the ways that cause user-mode or kernel-mode software to detect the presence of hypervisor by using delta timing side-channel attacks. It originates from the fact that this instruction leads to an unconditional VM-exit which, in the case of a hypervisor, it takes much longer to execute in contrast with a non-virtualized machine.

The description of these attacks is out of this article's scope, but in case you're interested, you can read a detailed explanation about these attacks in [this paper](https://research.hyperdbg.org/debugger/transparency.html).

### Instructions That Cause VM-exits Conditionally

Here is a list of instructions that cause VM-exits in VMX non-root operation depending on the setting of the VM-execution controls.
    - CLTS
    - ENCLS
    - HLT
    - IN, INS/INSB/INSW/INSD, OUT, OUTS/OUTSB/OUTSW/OUTSD.
    - INVLPG
    - INVPCID
    - LGDT, LIDT, LLDT, LTR, SGDT, SIDT, SLDT, STR
    - LMSW
    - MONITOR
    - MOV from CR3/CR8, MOV to CR0/1/3/4/8
    - MOV DR
    - MWAIT
    - PAUSE
    - RDMSR, WRMSR
    - RDPMC
    - RDRAND, RDSEED
    - RDTSC, RDTSCP
    - RSM
    - VMREAD, VMWRITE
    - WBINVD
    - XRSTORS, XSAVES

### Control Registers Modification Detection

Detecting and handling Control Registers' (CR) modifications is one of the great monitoring features provided by hypervisors.

Imagine if someone exploits the Windows Kernel (or any other OSs) and wants to unset one of the control register bits (let's say Write Protected or**SMEP**); then the hypervisor detects this modification and prevents further execution.

> Note that SMEP stands for Supervisor Mode Execution Protection. **CR4.SMEP** allows pages to be protected from supervisor-mode instruction fetches. If **CR4.SMEP = 1**, software operating in supervisor mode cannot fetch instructions from linear addresses that are accessible in user mode, and **WP** stands for **W**rite **P**rotect. **CR0.WP** allows pages to be protected from supervisor-mode writes. If **CR0.WP = 0**, supervisor-mode write accesses are allowed to linear addresses with read-only access rights; if **CR0.WP = 1**, they are not (User-mode write accesses are never allowed to linear addresses with read-only access rights, regardless of the value of CR0.WP).

Now it's time to implement our functions.

First, let's read the **GUEST\_CRs** and `EXIT_QUALIFICATION` of the VMCS.

```
    __vmx_vmread(EXIT_QUALIFICATION , &ExitQualification);
    __vmx_vmread(GUEST_CR0 , &GuestCR0);
    __vmx_vmread(GUEST_CR3 , &GuestCR3);
    __vmx_vmread(GUEST_CR4,  &GuestCR4);
```

As you can see, the following picture shows how we can interpret Exit Qualifications.

![](../../assets/images/control-register-access.png)

Note that `EXIT_QUALIFICATION` is somehow a general VMCS field that, in some situations like VM-exits caused by Invalid VMCS Layout, Control Register Modifications, I/O Bitmaps, and other events, gives additional information about the reason for the VM-exit.

As you can see from the above picture, let's make some variables to describe the situation based on `EXIT_QUALIFICATION`.

Whenever a VM-Exit occurs caused by instructions like `MOV CRx, REG`, we have to manually modify the **CRx** of guest VMCS from VMX-root mode. The following code shows how to change the **GUEST\_CRx** field of VMCS using VMWRITE.

```
     case TYPE_MOV_TO_CR:
    {
        switch (data->Fields.ControlRegister)
        {
        case 0:
            __vmx_vmwrite(GUEST_CR0, *RegPtr);
            __vmx_vmwrite(CR0_READ_SHADOW, *RegPtr);
            break;
        case 3:

            __vmx_vmwrite(GUEST_CR3, (*RegPtr & ~(1ULL << 63)));

            //
            // In the case of using EPT, the context of EPT/VPID should be
            // invalidated
            //
            break;
        case 4:
            __vmx_vmwrite(GUEST_CR4, *RegPtr);
            __vmx_vmwrite(CR4_READ_SHADOW, *RegPtr);
            break;
        default:
            DbgPrint("[*] Unsupported register %d\n", data->Fields.ControlRegister);
            break;
        }
    }
    break;
```

Otherwise, we have to read the **CRx** from our guest VMCS (not host Control Register as it might be different), then put it into the corresponding registers (in registers that we saved when the VM-exit handler called), then continue with **VMRESUME**. This way, the guest thinks as if it executed the `MOV reg, CRx` successfully.

```
    case TYPE_MOV_FROM_CR:
    {
        switch (data->Fields.ControlRegister)
        {
        case 0:
            __vmx_vmread(GUEST_CR0, RegPtr);
            break;
        case 3:
            __vmx_vmread(GUEST_CR3, RegPtr);
            break;
        case 4:
            __vmx_vmread(GUEST_CR4, RegPtr);
            break;
        default:
            DbgPrint("[*] Unsupported register %d\n", data->Fields.ControlRegister);
            break;
        }
    }
```

Putting it all together, we have a function like this :

```
VOID
HandleControlRegisterAccess(PGUEST_REGS GuestState)
{
    ULONG ExitQualification = 0;

    __vmx_vmread(EXIT_QUALIFICATION, &ExitQualification);

    PMOV_CR_QUALIFICATION data = (PMOV_CR_QUALIFICATION)&ExitQualification;

    PULONG64 RegPtr = (PULONG64)&GuestState->rax + data->Fields.Register;

    //
    // Because its RSP and as we didn't save RSP correctly (because of pushes)
    // so we have to make it points to the GUEST_RSP
    //
    if (data->Fields.Register == 4)
    {
        INT64 RSP = 0;
        __vmx_vmread(GUEST_RSP, &RSP);
        *RegPtr = RSP;
    }

    switch (data->Fields.AccessType)
    {
    case TYPE_MOV_TO_CR:
    {
        switch (data->Fields.ControlRegister)
        {
        case 0:
            __vmx_vmwrite(GUEST_CR0, *RegPtr);
            __vmx_vmwrite(CR0_READ_SHADOW, *RegPtr);
            break;
        case 3:

            __vmx_vmwrite(GUEST_CR3, (*RegPtr & ~(1ULL << 63)));

            //
            // In the case of using EPT, the context of EPT/VPID should be
            // invalidated
            //
            break;
        case 4:
            __vmx_vmwrite(GUEST_CR4, *RegPtr);
            __vmx_vmwrite(CR4_READ_SHADOW, *RegPtr);
            break;
        default:
            DbgPrint("[*] Unsupported register %d\n", data->Fields.ControlRegister);
            break;
        }
    }
    break;

    case TYPE_MOV_FROM_CR:
    {
        switch (data->Fields.ControlRegister)
        {
        case 0:
            __vmx_vmread(GUEST_CR0, RegPtr);
            break;
        case 3:
            __vmx_vmread(GUEST_CR3, RegPtr);
            break;
        case 4:
            __vmx_vmread(GUEST_CR4, RegPtr);
            break;
        default:
            DbgPrint("[*] Unsupported register %d\n", data->Fields.ControlRegister);
            break;
        }
    }
    break;

    default:
        DbgPrint("[*] Unsupported operation %d\n", data->Fields.AccessType);
        break;
    }
}
```

The reason why implementing functions like **HandleControlRegisterAccess** is necessary is because some processors have 1-settings of some processor-based VM-execution controls like CR3-Load Exiting & CR3-Store Existing, so we have to manage these kinds of VM-exits by ourselves, but if our processor can continue without these settings, it's strongly recommended to reduce the amounts of VM-exits and avoid configuring the settings that lead to these kinds of VM-exits because modern OSs access control registers a lot; thus, it has a significant performance penalty.

### MSR Bitmaps

Everything here is based on whether you set the 28th bit of Primary Processor Based controls or not.

On processors that support the 1-setting of the "**use MSR bitmaps**" VM-execution control, the VM-execution control fields include the 64-bit physical address of four contiguous MSR bitmaps, which are each 1-KByte in size.

The definition of MSR bitmap is pretty clear in Intel SDM, so I just copied them from the original manual. After reading them, we'll start to implement them and put them into our hypervisor.

- Read bitmap for low MSRs (located at the MSR-bitmap address). This contains one bit for each MSR address in the range 00000000H to 00001FFFH. The bit determines whether the execution of RDMSR applied to that MSR causes a VM-exit.

- Read bitmap for high MSRs (located at the MSR-bitmap address plus 1024). This contains one bit for each MSR address in the range C0000000H toC0001FFFH. The bit determines whether the execution of RDMSR applied to that MSR causes a VM-exit.

- Write bitmap for low MSRs (located at the MSR-bitmap address plus 2048). This contains one bit for each MSR address in the range 00000000H to 00001FFFH. The bit determines whether the execution of WRMSR applied to that MSR causes a VM-exit.

- Write bitmap for high MSRs (located at the MSR-bitmap address plus 3072). This contains one bit for each MSR address in the range C0000000H toC0001FFFH. The bit determines whether the execution of WRMSR applied to that MSR causes a VM-exit.

OK, let's bring the above sentences into the codes. First, we'll write our handler for MSR VM-exits.

#### Handling MSRs Read**

In our passthrough hypervisor, if any of the **RDMSR** or **WRMSR** caused a VM-exit, we have to manually execute **RDMSR** or **WRMSR** and set the results into the registers. Because of this, we have a function to manage our RDMSRs like :

```
VOID
HandleMSRRead(PGUEST_REGS GuestRegs)
{
    MSR msr = {0};

    //
    // RDMSR. The RDMSR instruction causes a VM exit if any of the following are true:
    //
    // The "use MSR bitmaps" VM-execution control is 0.
    // The value of ECX is not in the ranges 00000000H - 00001FFFH and C0000000H - C0001FFFH
    // The value of ECX is in the range 00000000H - 00001FFFH and bit n in read bitmap for low MSRs is 1,
    //   where n is the value of ECX.
    // The value of ECX is in the range C0000000H - C0001FFFH and bit n in read bitmap for high MSRs is 1,
    //   where n is the value of ECX & 00001FFFH.
    //

    if (((GuestRegs->rcx <= 0x00001FFF)) || ((0xC0000000 <= GuestRegs->rcx) && (GuestRegs->rcx <= 0xC0001FFF)))
    {
        msr.Content = MSRRead((ULONG)GuestRegs->rcx);
    }
    else
    {
        msr.Content = 0;
    }

    GuestRegs->rax = msr.Low;
    GuestRegs->rdx = msr.High;
}
```

You can see that it just checks for the sanity of MSR and then executes the **RDMSR** and ultimately put the results into **RAX** and **RDX** (because a non-virtualized **RDMSR** does the same thing).

#### Handling MSRs Writes

There is another function for handling **WRMSR** VM-exits :

```
VOID
HandleMSRWrite(PGUEST_REGS GuestRegs)
{
    MSR msr = {0};

    //
    // Check for the sanity of MSR
    //
    if ((GuestRegs->rcx <= 0x00001FFF) || ((0xC0000000 <= GuestRegs->rcx) && (GuestRegs->rcx <= 0xC0001FFF)))
    {
        msr.Low  = (ULONG)GuestRegs->rax;
        msr.High = (ULONG)GuestRegs->rdx;
        MSRWrite((ULONG)GuestRegs->rcx, msr.Content);
    }
}
```

The functionality of the function is simple. Still, one thing that is worth experimenting by yourself is to avoid setting `CPU_BASED_ACTIVATE_MSR_BITMAP` in `CPU_BASED_VM_EXEC_CONTROL`, you'll see that all of the MSR reads and modifications will cause a VM-exit with these reasons :

- EXIT\_REASON\_MSR\_READ
- EXIT\_REASON\_MSR\_WRITE

This time, we have to pass everything to the above functions and log these VM-exits, so you can see what are MSRs that Windows use while running in the hypervisor. As I told you above, Windows executes a vast amount of MSR instructions, so it can make your system much slower than you can bear it.

OK, let's get back to our MSR Bitmap. We need two functions to Set bits of our MSR Bitmap.

```
VOID
SetBit(PVOID Addr, UINT64 Bit, BOOLEAN Set)
{
    PAGED_CODE();

    UINT64 Byte = Bit / 8;
    UINT64 Temp = Bit % 8;
    UINT64 N    = 7 - Temp;

    BYTE * Addr2 = Addr;
    if (Set)
    {
        Addr2[Byte] |= (1 << N);
    }
    else
    {
        Addr2[Byte] &= ~(1 << N);
    }
}
```

The other function is for retrieving a particular bit.

```
VOID
GetBit(PVOID Addr, UINT64 Bit)
{
    UINT64 Byte = 0, K = 0;
    Byte         = Bit / 8;
    K            = 7 - Bit % 8;
    BYTE * Addr2 = Addr;

    return Addr2[Byte] & (1 << K);
}

```

Now it's time to gather everything in one function based on the above descriptions about MSR Bitmaps. The following function first checks for the sanity of MSR; then, it changes the MSR Bitmap of the target logical core (this is why we hold both the Physical Address and the Virtual Address of MSR Bitmap, the physical address for VMCS fields, and the virtual address to ease the modification and future deallocation). If it's a read (**RDMSR**) for low MSRs, then set the corresponding bit in MSR Bitmap Virtual Address, if it's a write (**WRMSR**) for the low MSRs, then modify the MSR Bitmap + 2048 (as noted in Intel manual) and exact the same thing for high MSRs (between _0xC0000000_ and _0xC0001FFF_) but don't forget the subtraction (_0xC0000000_) because _0xC000nnnn_ is not a valid bit.

```
BOOLEAN
SetMsrBitmap(ULONG64 Msr, int ProcessID, BOOLEAN ReadDetection, BOOLEAN WriteDetection)
{
    if (!ReadDetection && !WriteDetection)
    {
        //
        // Invalid Command
        //
        return FALSE;
    }

    if (Msr <= 0x00001FFF)
    {
        if (ReadDetection)
        {
            SetBit(g_GuestState[ProcessID].MsrBitmap, Msr, TRUE);
        }
        if (WriteDetection)
        {
            SetBit(g_GuestState[ProcessID].MsrBitmap + 2048, Msr, TRUE);
        }
    }
    else if ((0xC0000000 <= Msr) && (Msr <= 0xC0001FFF))
    {
        if (ReadDetection)
        {
            SetBit(g_GuestState[ProcessID].MsrBitmap + 1024, Msr - 0xC0000000, TRUE);
        }
        if (WriteDetection)
        {
            SetBit(g_GuestState[ProcessID].MsrBitmap + 3072, Msr - 0xC0000000, TRUE);
        }
    }
    else
    {
        return FALSE;
    }
    return TRUE;
}
```

Just one more thing to remember, only the above MSR ranges are currently valid in Intel processors, so even any other RDMSRs and WRMSRs cause a VM-exit. Still, the sanity check here is mandatory as the guest might send invalid MSRs and cause the whole system to crash (in VMX root-mode). In the future parts, when we learn about the event injection, we'll simulate the physical machine's behavior by injecting events to the guest in the case when the guest attempted to access an invalid MSR.

## Turning off VMX and Exit from Hypervisor

It's time to turn off our hypervisor and restore the processor state to what it was before running the hypervisor.

Like how we enter hypervisor (**VMLAUNCH**), we have to combine our C functions with Assembly routines to save the state, execute **VMXOFF**, free all of our previously allocated pools, and finally restore the state.

The **VMXOFF** part of this routine should be executed in the VMX root-mode. You can't just execute `__vmx_vmxoff` in one of your driver functions and expect it turns off the hypervisor as Windows and all its drivers are currently running in VMX non-root, so executing any of the VMX instructions is like a VM-exit with one of the following reasons.

- EXIT\_REASON\_VMCLEAR
- EXIT\_REASON\_VMPTRLD
- EXIT\_REASON\_VMPTRST
- EXIT\_REASON\_VMREAD
- EXIT\_REASON\_VMRESUME
- EXIT\_REASON\_VMWRITE
- EXIT\_REASON\_VMXOFF
- EXIT\_REASON\_VMXON
- EXIT\_REASON\_VMLAUNCH

For turning off the hypervisor, it's better to use one of our IRP Major functions. In our case, we used `DrvClose` as it always gets notified whenever a handle to our device is closed. If you remember from the above, we create a handle from our device using `CreateFile` (`DrvCreate`), and now it's time to close our handle using `DrvClose`.

```
NTSTATUS
DrvClose(IN PDEVICE_OBJECT DeviceObject, IN PIRP Irp)
{
    DbgPrint("[*] DrvClose Called !\n");

    // executing VMXOFF (From CPUID) on every logical processor
    TerminateVmx();

    Irp->IoStatus.Status      = STATUS_SUCCESS;
    Irp->IoStatus.Information = 0;
    IoCompleteRequest(Irp, IO_NO_INCREMENT);

    return STATUS_SUCCESS;
}
```

Nothing special about the above function; only the `TerminateVmx` is added.

This function is similar to the routine of executing **VMLAUNCH**, except it runs **VMXOFF** instead.

```
VOID
TerminateVmx()
{
    DbgPrint("\n[*] Terminating VMX...\n");

    int LogicalProcessorsCount = KeQueryActiveProcessorCount(0);

    for (size_t i = 0; i < LogicalProcessorsCount; i++)
    {
        DbgPrint("\t\t + Terminating VMX on processor %d\n", i);
        RunOnProcessorForTerminateVMX(i);

        //
        // Free the destination memory
        //
        MmFreeContiguousMemory(PhysicalToVirtualAddress(g_GuestState[i].VmxonRegion));
        MmFreeContiguousMemory(PhysicalToVirtualAddress(g_GuestState[i].VmcsRegion));
        ExFreePoolWithTag(g_GuestState[i].VmmStack, POOLTAG);
        ExFreePoolWithTag(g_GuestState[i].MsrBitmap, POOLTAG);
    }

    DbgPrint("[*] VMX Operation turned off successfully. \n");
}
```

As you can see, it executes `RunOnProcessorForTerminateVMX` on all the running logical cores. It then frees the allocated buffers for `VmxonRegion`, `VmcsRegion`, `VmmStack`, and `MsrBitmap` using `MmFreeContiguousMemory` and, of course, converts physicals to virtuals whenever needed.

Note that you have to modify this function if you virtualized a portion of cores (not all).

In `RunOnProcessorForTerminateVMX`, we must tell theVMX Root Operation about turning off the hypervisor. As I told you, it's because we can't execute any VMX instructions in the regular driver routines, and it's pretty clear that VMX Root Operation can prevent us from this operation if there isn't any mechanism for handling this situation or we're not privileged enough to unload the hypervisor.

There are several ways to tell our VMX Root Operation about **VMXOFF**, but in our case, we'll use **CPUID**.

By now, you definitely know that executing **CPUID** will cause VM-exit. Now in our **CPUID** exit handler routine, we manage that whenever a **CPUID** with `RAX = 0x41414141` and `RCX = 0x42424242` is executed, then we have to return **true**, and it shows the caller that the hypervisor needs to be off.

```
    if ((state->rax == 0x41414141) && (state->rcx == 0x42424242) && Mode == DPL_SYSTEM)
    {
        return TRUE; // Indicates we have to turn off VMX
    }
```

There is also another check for **DPL** to make sure that **CPUID** with `RAX = 0x41414141` and `RCX = 0x42424242` is only executed in the system privilege level (kernel-mode). Hence, none of the user-mode applications are able to unload our hypervisor.

```
    ULONG Mode = 0;
    __vmx_vmread(GUEST_CS_SELECTOR, &Mode);
    Mode = Mode & RPL_MASK;
```

Now our `RunOnProcessorForTerminateVMX` executes **CPUID** with adjusted values into registers on all cores separately.

```
BOOLEAN
RunOnProcessorForTerminateVMX(ULONG ProcessorNumber)
{
    KIRQL OldIrql;
    INT32 CpuInfo[4];

    KeSetSystemAffinityThread((KAFFINITY)(1 << ProcessorNumber));

    OldIrql = KeRaiseIrqlToDpcLevel();

    //
    // Our routine is VMXOFF
    //
    __cpuidex(CpuInfo, 0x41414141, 0x42424242);

    KeLowerIrql(OldIrql);

    KeRevertToUserAffinityThread();

    return TRUE;
}
```

In the `EXIT_REASON_CPUID` handler, we know that if the handler returns true, then we have to turn it off, so we should think about some other things. For example, Windows expects to later continue from `GUEST_RIP` and needs its previous `GUEST_RSP` whenever the VM-exit handler returns; thus, we have to save them in some locations and use them later to restore the Windows state.

Also, we have to increase **GUEST\_RIP** because we want to restore the state after the CPUID.

```
    case EXIT_REASON_CPUID:
    {
        Status = HandleCPUID(GuestRegs); // Detect whether we have to turn off VMX or Not
        if (Status)
        {
            // We have to save GUEST_RIP & GUEST_RSP somewhere to restore them directly

            ULONG ExitInstructionLength = 0;
            g_GuestRIP                  = 0;
            g_GuestRSP                  = 0;
            __vmx_vmread(GUEST_RIP, &g_GuestRIP);
            __vmx_vmread(GUEST_RSP, &g_GuestRSP);
            __vmx_vmread(VM_EXIT_INSTRUCTION_LEN, &ExitInstructionLength);

            g_GuestRIP += ExitInstructionLength;
        }
        break;
    }
```

From the 5th part, you probably know `MainVmexitHandler` is called from `VmexitHandler` (Assembly function from **VMExitHandler.asm**)

Let's see it in detail.

First, we have to extern some previously defined variables.

```
EXTERN g_GuestRIP:QWORD
EXTERN g_GuestRSP:QWORD
```

Now our `VmexitHandler` works like this, whenever a VM-exit occurs, the target logical core executes `VmexitHandler` as it's defined in `HOST_RIP`, and our **RSP** is set to `HOST_RSP`, then we have to save all the registers. It means we must create a structure that allows us to read and modify registers in a C-like structure.

```
typedef struct _GUEST_REGS
{
    ULONG64 rax; // 0x00         // NOT VALID FOR SVM
    ULONG64 rcx;
    ULONG64 rdx; // 0x10
    ULONG64 rbx;
    ULONG64 rsp; // 0x20         // rsp is not stored here on SVM
    ULONG64 rbp;
    ULONG64 rsi; // 0x30
    ULONG64 rdi;
    ULONG64 r8; // 0x40
    ULONG64 r9;
    ULONG64 r10; // 0x50
    ULONG64 r11;
    ULONG64 r12; // 0x60
    ULONG64 r13;
    ULONG64 r14; // 0x70
    ULONG64 r15;
} GUEST_REGS, *PGUEST_REGS;
```

Just push all the registers in the `GUEST_REGS` structure order and push the **RSP** as the first argument to `MainVmexitHandler` (Fastcall **RCX**), then some subtraction for Shadow Space.

You can see the `VmexitHandler` here:

```
VmexitHandler PROC

    PUSH R15
    PUSH R14
    PUSH R13
    PUSH R12
    PUSH R11
    PUSH R10
    PUSH R9
    PUSH R8        
    PUSH RDI
    PUSH RSI
    PUSH RBP
    PUSH RBP	; RSP
    PUSH RBX
    PUSH RDX
    PUSH RCX
    PUSH RAX	


	MOV RCX, RSP		; Fast CALL argument to PGUEST_REGS
	SUB	RSP, 28h		; Free some space for Shadow Section

	CALL	MainVmexitHandler

	ADD	RSP, 28h		; Restore the state

	; Check whether we have to turn off VMX or Not (the result is in RAX)

	CMP	AL, 1
	JE		VmxoffHandler

	; Restore the state
	POP RAX
    POP RCX
    POP RDX
    POP RBX
    POP RBP		; RSP
    POP RBP
    POP RSI
    POP RDI 
    POP R8
    POP R9
    POP R10
    POP R11
    POP R12
    POP R13
    POP R14
    POP R15

	SUB RSP, 0100h ; to avoid error in future functions

	JMP VmResumeInstruction
	

VmexitHandler ENDP
```

From the above code, when we return from the `MainVmexitHandler`, we have to check whether the return result of `MainVmexitHandler` (in **RAX**) tells us to turn off the hypervisor or just continue.

If it needs to be continued, restore the registers state and jump to our `VmResumeInstruction` function.

`VmResumeInstruction` executes `__vmx_vmresume` and the processor sets the **RIP** register to `GUEST_RIP`.

```
VOID
VmResumeInstruction()
{
    ULONG64 ErrorCode = 0;

    __vmx_vmresume();

    //
    // if VMRESUME succeeds will never be here!
    //
    __vmx_vmread(VM_INSTRUCTION_ERROR, &ErrorCode);
    __vmx_off();
    DbgPrint("[*] VMRESUME Error : 0x%llx\n", ErrorCode);

    //
    // It's such a bad error because we don't where to go
    // prefer to break
    //
    DbgBreakPoint();
}
```

But what if it needs to be turned off?

Then based on the **AL** register, it jumps to another function called `VmxoffHandler`. This function executes the **VMXOFF** instruction, turns off the hypervisor (in the current logical core), and then restores the registers to their previous state as we saved them in `VmexitHandler`.

The only thing we have to do here is changing the stack pointer to `GUEST_RSP` (We saved them in `g_GuestRSP`) and jump to the `GUEST_RIP` (saved in `g_GuestRIP`).

```
VmxoffHandler PROC

	; Turn VMXOFF
	VMXOFF

	; Restore the state

	POP RAX
    POP RCX
    POP RDX
    POP RBX
    POP RBP		; RSP
    POP RBP
    POP RSI
    POP RDI 
    POP R8
    POP R9
    POP R10
    POP R11
    POP R12
    POP R13
    POP R14
    POP R15

	; Set guest RIP and RSP

	MOV		RSP, g_GuestRSP

	JMP		g_GuestRIP

VmxoffHandler ENDP
```

Now everything is done, we executed our normal Windows (driver) routine; I mean, start the execution after the last **CPUID** that was executed from `RunOnProcessorForTerminateVMX` but now we're not in VMX operation.

## VM-Exit Handler

Putting all the above codes together, now we have to manage different kinds of VM-exits, so we need to modify our previously explained (in the 5th part) VM-exit handler; if you forget about it, please review the 5th part (**VM-Exit Handler**), it's exactly the same but with different actions for various exit reasons.

The first thing we need to manage is to detect every VMX instructions that are executed in VMX non-root operation; it can be done using the following code :

```
    //
    // 25.1.2  Instructions That Cause VM Exits Unconditionally
    // The following instructions cause VM exits when they are executed in VMX non-root operation: CPUID, GETSEC,
    // INVD, and XSETBV. This is also true of instructions introduced with VMX, which include: INVEPT, INVVPID,
    // VMCALL, VMCLEAR, VMLAUNCH, VMPTRLD, VMPTRST, VMRESUME, VMXOFF, and VMXON.
    //
    case EXIT_REASON_VMCLEAR:
    case EXIT_REASON_VMPTRLD:
    case EXIT_REASON_VMPTRST:
    case EXIT_REASON_VMREAD:
    case EXIT_REASON_VMRESUME:
    case EXIT_REASON_VMWRITE:
    case EXIT_REASON_VMXOFF:
    case EXIT_REASON_VMXON:
    case EXIT_REASON_VMLAUNCH:
    {
        // DbgBreakPoint();

        /*	DbgPrint("\n [*] Target guest tries to execute VM Instruction ,"
                "it probably causes a fatal error or system halt as the system might"
                " think it has VMX feature enabled while it's not available due to our use of hypervisor.\n");
                */

        ULONG RFLAGS = 0;
        __vmx_vmread(GUEST_RFLAGS, &RFLAGS);
        __vmx_vmwrite(GUEST_RFLAGS, RFLAGS | 0x1); // cf=1 indicate vm instructions fail
        break;
    }
```

As I told you in **DbgPrint**, executing these kinds of VMX instructions will eventually cause BSOD because there might be some checks for the presence of a hypervisor before our hypervisor comes. Hence, the routine that executes these instructions (of course, it's from the kernel) probably thinks it can execute these instructions. If it didn't manage them well (which is common), you'll see BSOD. Thus, you have to discover the cause of invoking these kinds of instructions and manually disable them.

If you configured any CPU-based controls or your processor support 1-settings of any of the CR Access Exit controls, you could manage them using the following VM-exit.

```
    case EXIT_REASON_CR_ACCESS:
    {
        HandleControlRegisterAccess(GuestRegs);
        break;
    }
```

The same thing is true for MSRs accesses. If we didn't set any MSR Bit, every **RDMSR** and **WRMSR** cause to exit, or if we set any bits in `MsrBitmap`, then we have to manage them using the following function for **RDMSR**:

```
    case EXIT_REASON_MSR_READ:
    {
        ULONG ECX = GuestRegs->rcx & 0xffffffff;

        // DbgPrint("[*] RDMSR (based on bitmap) : 0x%llx\n", ECX);
        HandleMSRRead(GuestRegs);

        break;
    }
```

And this code for managing **WRMSR**:

```
    case EXIT_REASON_MSR_WRITE:
    {
        ULONG ECX = GuestRegs->rcx & 0xffffffff;

        DbgPrint("[*] WRMSR (based on bitmap) : 0x%llx\n", ECX);
        HandleMSRWrite(GuestRegs);

        break;
    }
```

And if you want to detect I/O instruction execution, then:

```
    case EXIT_REASON_IO_INSTRUCTION:
    {
        UINT64 RIP = 0;
        __vmx_vmread(GUEST_RIP, &RIP);

        DbgPrint("[*] RIP executed IO instruction : 0x%llx\n", RIP);
        DbgBreakPoint();

        break;
    }
```

Don't forget to set adequate CPU-based control fields if you want to use the above functionalities.

The last thing that is important for us is the **CPUID** Handler. It calls `HandleCPUID` (described above), and if the result is _true_, then it saves the `GUEST_RSP` and `GUEST_RIP` so that these values can be used to restore the state after **VMXOFF** is executed in the target core.

```
    case EXIT_REASON_CPUID:
    {
        Status = HandleCPUID(GuestRegs); // Detect whether we have to turn off VMX or Not
        if (Status)
        {
            // We have to save GUEST_RIP & GUEST_RSP somewhere to restore them directly

            ULONG ExitInstructionLength = 0;
            g_GuestRIP                  = 0;
            g_GuestRSP                  = 0;
            __vmx_vmread(GUEST_RIP, &g_GuestRIP);
            __vmx_vmread(GUEST_RSP, &g_GuestRSP);
            __vmx_vmread(VM_EXIT_INSTRUCTION_LEN, &ExitInstructionLength);

            g_GuestRIP += ExitInstructionLength;
        }
        break;
    }
```

## Let's Test it!

Now it's time to test our hypervisor.

### Virtualizing all the cores

First, we have to load our driver.

![](../../assets/images/running-HVFS-1.png)

Then our `DriverEntry` is called, so we have to run our user-mode application to virtualize all the cores.

![](../../assets/images/running-HVFS-2.png)

You can see that if you press any key or close this window, it'll call `DrvClose` and restores the state (**VMXOFF**).

![](../../assets/images/running-HVFS-3.png)

The above picture shows the driver logs. At this point, all the cores are now under the hypervisor.

### Changing CPUID using Hypervisor

Now let's test the presence of the hypervisor. For this case, I used Immunity Debugger to execute **CPUID** with custom **EAX**. You can use any other debugger or any custom application.

![](../../assets/images/cpuid-handle-1.png)

We have to manually set the **EAX** to **0x40000001** or the `HYPERV_CPUID_INTERFACE` and then execute **CPUID**.

![](../../assets/images/cpuid-handle-2.png)

As you can see, **HVFS** (0x48564653) is on **EAX**, so we successfully hooked the **CPUID** execution using our hypervisor.

![](../../assets/images/cpuid-handle-3.png)

The above picture shows the `HYPERV_CPUID_INTERFACE` without the hypervisor.

At last, we have to close the user-mode app window, so it executes **VMXOFF** on all cores. Let's test the above example again.

![](../../assets/images/cpuid-handle-4.png)

You can see that the actual results have appeared as we're no longer under the hypervisor.

### Detecting MSR Read & Write (MSR Bitmap)

In order to test MSR Bitmaps, I create a local kernel debugger (using WinDbg). In WinDbg, we can execute `rdmsr` and `wrmsr` commands to read and write into MSRs. It's exactly like executing **RDMSR** and **WRMSR** using a system driver.

In the `VirtualizeCurrentSystem` function, the following line is added.

```
    SetMSRBitmap(0xc0000082, ProcessorID, TRUE, TRUE);
```

![](../../assets/images/MSR-bitmap-1.png)

In WinDbg Local Debugger, we executed the above commands, and in the remote debugger, we can see the result as follows,

![](../../assets/images/MSR-bitmap-2.png)

As you can see, the execution of **RDMSR** is detected. Our hypervisor is working perfectly!

That's it all, folks.

![](../../assets/images/anime-girl-reading-book.jpg)

## Conclusion

In this part, we saw how we could virtualize an already running system by configuring the VMCS fields separately for each logical core. Then we used our hypervisor to change the result of the **CPUID** instruction and monitor every access to control registers or MSRs. After this part, our hypervisor is almost ready to be used for a practical project. The future part is about using the Extended Page Table (as described previously in the 4th part). I believe most of the exciting works in hypervisor can be performed using EPT because it has a special logging mechanism, e.g., page read/write access detection and many other cool things you'll see in the next parts.

See you in the next part.
